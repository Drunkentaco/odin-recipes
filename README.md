HTML Project: Recipes

This project is practice of using all of the HTML knowledge that I have acquired, I have made basic recipe website which consist of a main index page that have links to a few recipes. Keep in mind that I will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS. Stay tune! -Daniel
