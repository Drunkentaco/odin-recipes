        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F and set a rack in the lower middle position.</li>
            <li>Pat the beef dry and mix it with flour, salt, and pepper </li>
            <li>In a heavy soup pot, heat around 1 tablespoon sunflower oil over medium-high heat until hot and shimmering. </li>
            <li>Brown the meat on each side (<strong>DON'T OVERCROWD THE MEAT</strong>) for about 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Add one more tablespoon of oil for each batch and repeat step 4 until no meat left</li>
            <li>Transfer the meat to a large plate or bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the onions, garlic and balsamic vinegar and cook for 5 minutes (<strong>scrap brown bits with wooden spoon</strong>)</li>
            <li>Add the tomato paste and cook for a minute more.</li>
            <li>Add the beef with its juices back to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the wine, beef broth, water, bay leaf, thyme, and sugar  and bring to a boil (<strong>scrap brown bits with wooden spoon</strong>)</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid, transfer to the preheated oven, and braise for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from the oven and add the carrots, celery, and potatoes.</li>
            <li>Cover and place back in the oven for about an hour more, or until the vegetables are cooked, the broth is thickened, and the meat is tender.</li>
            <li>If broth not thickened enough, make slurry (2 tablespoons cornstarch +2 tablespoons of water) and boil for 3 minutes until desired thickness.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired. <strong>Bon appetit!</strong></li>
