        <ol>
            <li>Zest and juice the lemon. Peel, halve and small dice the onion. Thinly slice the sun-dried tomatoes.</li>

Add the broth; season with S&P. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, 20 to 25 minutes, until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is al dente (Still form to the bite).</li>
            <li>While the rice cooks, heat a small dry pan on medium-high. Add the pine nuts and toast, stirring frequently (keep an eye on them as they can burn easily). Immediately transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the goat cheese, 2 tbsp of butter ( double for 4 portions) and Â½ the lemon juice to the cooked rice. Cook for another 2 minutes, stirring constantly; season with S&P to taste.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the arugula, remaining lemon juice and as much of lemon zest as you'd like; drizzle with olive oil and season with S&P to taste, Divide the finished risotto between your plates and drizzle with the pesto. Top the risotto with the toasted pine nuts. Serve the remaining arugula salad on the side. <strong>Bon appetit!</strong></li>
